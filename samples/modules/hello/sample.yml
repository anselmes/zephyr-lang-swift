# Hello Swift Module Sample Definition
# =============================================================================
#
# This YAML file defines the metadata and configuration for the "Hello" Swift
# sample module. This file is used by Zephyr's sample and testing framework
# to understand how to build, test, and document this sample module.
#
# Sample Purpose:
# ---------------
# The Hello sample module demonstrates:
# - Creating reusable Swift libraries for Zephyr RTOS
# - Proper Swift module structure and organization
# - Integration with Zephyr's module and configuration systems
# - Template for developers creating custom Swift modules
# - Best practices for Swift library development in embedded contexts
#
# Integration with Zephyr:
# ------------------------
# This sample integrates with Zephyr's framework by:
# - Providing metadata for the sample discovery system
# - Enabling automated testing through the twister framework
# - Documenting the sample for inclusion in documentation builds
# - Following Zephyr's sample organization standards
#
# Usage by Developers:
# --------------------
# Developers can use this sample to:
# 1. Learn Swift module creation patterns for Zephyr
# 2. Copy and adapt the structure for custom modules
# 3. Understand proper Kconfig integration for Swift modules
# 4. See examples of Swift library API design for embedded use
#
# Testing Integration:
# --------------------
# This sample can be tested using:
# - Manual compilation and testing
# - Integration with applications that import the module
# - Automated testing through Zephyr's test framework
# - Validation of module build and dependency resolution
#

# Sample metadata configuration
# This section defines the basic information about this Swift sample module
sample:
  # Human-readable name for the sample module
  # This name appears in documentation, test reports, and sample listings
  # It should clearly identify this as a Swift library sample for Zephyr
  name: Hello Swift Sample Module
