# =============================================================================
# Swift Application Sample Definition
# =============================================================================
#
# This YAML file defines the metadata and configuration for the Swift
# application sample. This file is used by Zephyr's sample and testing
# framework to understand how to build, test, and document this Swift
# application example.
#
# Sample Purpose:
# ---------------
# The Swift application sample demonstrates:
# - Basic Swift application structure for Zephyr RTOS
# - Proper entry point definition using @_cdecl("entrypoint")
# - Integration with Zephyr's kernel APIs and system functions
# - Swift syntax and patterns suitable for embedded development
# - Configuration and build setup for Swift applications
#
# Key Features Demonstrated:
# --------------------------
# - Swift application lifecycle and main loop patterns
# - Basic I/O operations using print statements
# - Integration with Zephyr's timing and sleep functions
# - Proper resource management in embedded Swift contexts
# - Configuration through prj.conf and CMake build system
#
# Learning Objectives:
# --------------------
# After studying this sample, developers will understand:
# - How to structure a basic Swift application for Zephyr
# - The role of the entrypoint function in Swift-Zephyr integration
# - How to configure Swift compilation for embedded targets
# - Basic patterns for embedded Swift application development
# - Integration points between Swift and Zephyr RTOS
#
# Testing and Validation:
# -----------------------
# This sample can be tested by:
# - Building for various supported target architectures
# - Running on QEMU emulation for quick validation
# - Deploying to physical hardware for real-world testing
# - Automated testing through Zephyr's twister framework
#
# Development Template:
# ---------------------
# This sample serves as a template for:
# - Creating new Swift applications for Zephyr
# - Understanding basic Swift-Zephyr integration patterns
# - Learning proper configuration and build setup
# - Establishing development workflows for Swift on Zephyr
#

# Sample metadata configuration
# This section defines the basic information about this Swift application sample
sample:
  # Human-readable name for the sample application
  # This name appears in documentation, test reports, and sample listings
  # It should clearly identify this as a Swift application example for Zephyr
  name: Swift Application Sample
