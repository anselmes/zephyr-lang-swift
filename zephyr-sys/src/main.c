 * @file main.c
 * @brief ZephyrSys Main Module - Swift Runtime Support for Zephyr RTOS
 *
 * This file serves as the main module for the ZephyrSys library, which provides
 * essential C runtime support for Swift code running on Zephyr RTOS. The
 * ZephyrSys library bridges the gap between Swift's runtime expectations and
 * Zephyr's minimal embedded C environment.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 *
 * Swift code compiled for embedded systems expects certain C library functions
 * and runtime support that may not be available in Zephyr's minimal C library.
 * This module coordinates the various runtime support components provided by
 * the ZephyrSys library.
 *
 * ## Components Coordinated
 *
 * - **Memory Management**: Stub implementations for aligned memory allocation
 *   functions like `aligned_alloc()` and `posix_memalign()`
 * - **Random Number Generation**: Stub implementations for `getentropy()` and
 *   related functions needed by Swift's runtime
 * - **POSIX Compatibility**: Basic POSIX function stubs that Swift expects
 * - **Bridging Support**: Integration points between Swift and Zephyr APIs
 *
 * ## Integration with Swift
 *
 * This module works in conjunction with:
 * - `BridgingHeader.h`: Exposes Zephyr APIs to Swift code
 * - `module.modulemap`: Provides Clang module mapping for Swift
 * interoperability
 * - Swift-specific runtime stubs implemented elsewhere in the ZephyrSys library
 *
 * ## Build Integration
 *
 * This file is compiled as part of the ZephyrSys static library, which is then
 * linked into all Swift applications and libraries to provide the necessary
 * runtime support for Swift code execution on Zephyr RTOS.
 *
 * @note This file currently serves as a placeholder for future expansion.
 *       Actual runtime stub implementations are provided by other modules
 *       in the ZephyrSys library.
 *
 * @see BridgingHeader.h For Swift-C API bridging
 * @see module.modulemap For Clang module definitions

/**
 * @brief Initialize ZephyrSys runtime support (if needed)
 *
 * This function can be used to perform any initialization required by the
 * ZephyrSys runtime support library. Currently, no initialization is needed
 * as the runtime stubs are stateless, but this provides a hook for future
 * expansion.
 *
 * @note This function is currently a placeholder and performs no operations.
 *       It may be extended in the future to initialize runtime state if needed.
