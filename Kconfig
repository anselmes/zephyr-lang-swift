config SWIFT
  bool "Swift language support"
  help
    Enable support for the Swift programming language.

    This enables the Swift compiler and related tools to be used within
    the Zephyr build system. Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming
    language for macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and beyond.

    Note: Ensure that you have the Swift toolchain installed on your system
    to use this feature.

  depends on SWIFT
  default y if DEBUG
  help
    When enabled, this option includes debug information in the compiled
    Swift binaries. This is useful for debugging and development purposes.

    Note: Including debug information may increase the size of the binary
    and affect performance. Disable this option for production builds.
